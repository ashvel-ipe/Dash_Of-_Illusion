Project Description
A car sim where everything’s wrong and nothing matters. Press buttons. Regret everything. 😎

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern dashboards are way too helpful. They assist drivers, prevent accidents, and provide accurate information — how boring. 
There is a severe shortage of chaotic, unpredictable, and hilariously frustrating driving simulators that teach you absolutely nothing. 
In a world overloaded with realism and logic, there’s an urgent lack of pure, unfiltered nonsense on wheels.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A car sim where everything’s wrong and nothing matters. Press buttons. Regret everything. 😎

so user tries but didnt succeed

The screen opens with our golden-yellow car, engine off, parked confidently on an endless 2D road. The user, clearly excited and overestimating their driving skills, starts mashing buttons at random.

They press the clutch first. Boom — “First time driving huh?” — but the engine magically starts.
Without hesitation, they tap the accelerator — “Physics is on vacation!” — the car starts crawling left even though the engine flickers off again.
Confused but determined, they try shifting to Drive — only to be met with “Clutch is for show huh?” and a jarring car halt.
Now angry, they press brake, and magically the gear shift works — “Brakes are the new clutch.”
The engine now starts just by tapping the headlights (why? because logic is gone).
They floor the accelerator in Neutral. RPM spikes, “Easy bro… we got nowhere to go.”

Suddenly, they press everything at once:
🚗 The car jitters.
🚦 All icons flash red.
🧠 RPM shows 9999.
💥 A huge sarcastic message fades in:
“You broke it. You happy now?”

The video ends with the car disappearing off-screen while the handbrake icon smiles. The final screen reads:

“This simulator has no purpose. You have reached enlightenment.”
