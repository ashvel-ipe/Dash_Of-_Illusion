Project Description
A car sim where everything‚Äôs wrong and nothing matters. Press buttons. Regret everything. üòé

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern dashboards are way too helpful. They assist drivers, prevent accidents, and provide accurate information ‚Äî how boring. 
There is a severe shortage of chaotic, unpredictable, and hilariously frustrating driving simulators that teach you absolutely nothing. 
In a world overloaded with realism and logic, there‚Äôs an urgent lack of pure, unfiltered nonsense on wheels.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A car sim where everything‚Äôs wrong and nothing matters. Press buttons. Regret everything. üòé
